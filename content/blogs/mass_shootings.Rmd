```{r}
#| label: load-libraries
#| echo: false # This option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(tidyverse)
library(wbstats)
library(skimr)
library(countrycode)
library(here)
library(ggthemes)
library(extrafont)
library(viridis)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(cowplot)
library(patchwork)

```

## Obtain the data
First we begin by reading the mass_shootings csv and saving it to a table, here you can find a glimpse of that csv to understand which dimensions, data types and data is stored in each column

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false


mass_shootings <- read_csv(here::here("data", "mass_shootings.csv"))

glimpse(mass_shootings)
```
Then we generate a bar chart that identifies the number of mass shooters associated with each race category. The bars are sorted from highest to lowest and each bar shows its number.

```{r}

#Create a dataframe that groups by race and I renamed the duplicated race categories so that the information is collapsed into one variable per race category. Then I collapse all the others into Other. Afterwards, I reorder the information using fct_reorder and get it ready to plot it

dfmass_shootings <- mass_shootings %>% 
  group_by(race) %>% 
  mutate(race = case_when(
    race %in% c("White", "white") ~ "White", 
    race %in% c("Black", "black") ~ "Black", 
    race %in% c("Asian", "Latino", "Native American", "") ~ race,
    TRUE ~ "Other"  # Collapse other races into "Other" category
  )) %>% 
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  mutate(race = fct_reorder(race, count, .desc = TRUE))

# Get unique race categories
unique_races <- unique(dfmass_shootings$race) #define a unique list of categories

# Generate a color palette for each race category
num_races <- length(unique_races)
custom_colors <- brewer.pal(num_races, "Set1")

# Generate the bar chart
chart <- ggplot(dfmass_shootings, aes(x = race, y = count, fill = race)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_economist(base_family = "ITC Officina Sans", dkpanel = TRUE) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = 1, colour = "black", size = 4.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of mass shooters by race",
    subtitle = "Total number in units",
    x = "Race",
    y = "Number of mass shooters",
    fill = "Race"
  )

chart
```

Now we want to understand the frequency per location of the mass shootings, to do so we generate a boxplot visualizing the number of total victims, by type of location, but removing the Las Vegas Strip massacre outlier from the dataset.

```{r}

#I create dfmass_shootings and exclude the Las Vegas Strip Massacre and re plot the data using the same code as the question above

dfmass_shootings <- mass_shootings %>% 
  filter(case !="Las Vegas Strip massacre")

# Get unique race categories
unique_location <- unique(dfmass_shootings$location_type)

# Generate a color palette for each race category
num_location <- length(unique_location)
custom_colors <- rainbow(num_location)

# Generate the bar chart
chart <- ggplot(dfmass_shootings, aes(x = location_type, y = total_victims, fill = location_type)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_economist(base_family = "ITC Officina Sans", dkpanel = TRUE) +
  scale_colour_economist() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = custom_colors) +
  labs(
    title = "Number of Total Victims by Location",
    x = "Location",
    y = "Number of Total Victims",
    fill = "Location"
  )

chart
```
