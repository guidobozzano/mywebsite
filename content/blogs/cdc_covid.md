This first graph helps us understand how negatively is the COVID case fatality ratio if we breakdown the information by age, sex and whether the people with COVID were admitted in the ICU or not. From this graph we can conclude that the CASE fatality ratio is quite high (>63%) for both Female and Males that were admitted in the ICU whereas those that weren't remains relatively low. In essence this helps us understand that it doesn't matter the sex rather than whether the person was admitted in ICU to understand how the CFR ratio will behave.

This graph displays the CFR % by country population. As we can observe the large metropolitan areas are the ones that exhibit the highest CFR ratios. This relates to how the COVID-19 spreads itself, as large density areas have more people in a smaller places we can see how fast the disease spreads. Given that the disease reaches more people we should expect to have more people that are killed by the infection. On the other hand, in low density areas COVID doesn't spread and since it doesn't spread we have less people that could potentially turn into fatalities

This next charts shows the evolution of the CFR % over time with a breakdown by sex, ICU admission and age. As expected we see that CFR % is higher in those cases that were admitted in the ICU. However, as the diseases has some seasonality component we can see how the CFR % fluctuates over time.

Last, this chart displays the CFR % over time breakdown by Rural and Urban areas. Given the virus dynamics we can clearly see how the CFR % is greater in Urban compared to Rural. This relates to the point mentioned above for chart 2
